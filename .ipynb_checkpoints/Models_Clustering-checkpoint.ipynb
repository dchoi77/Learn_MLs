    "The silhouette score of a dataset is the mean of the silhoutte coefficients of all instances in the dataset. The silhoutte coefficient of an instance $\\mathbf{x}$ which belongs to the cluster $C$ with $|C|>1$ is defined by $(b - a)/\\max\\{a,b\\}$, where $a = \\frac{1}{|C|-1}\\sum_{y\\in C} ||\\mathbf{x} - \\mathbf{y}||$ and $b = \\min_{C^\\prime \\neq C} \\frac{1}{|C^\\prime|} \\sum_{\\mathbf{y}\\in C^\\prime} ||\\mathbf{x} - \\mathbf{y}||$.
